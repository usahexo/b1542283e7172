#  What exactly casino game gives you typically the most comps India? 

Each casino game offers different comps. Some games offer more comps than others. The game that typically gives you the most comps is blackjack. This is because blackjack is a slower paced game and allows the casino more opportunity to track your play and give you rewards for it. In general, the more you gamble, the more comps you will receive.

#  Slot machines offer best comps in India casinos 

Slot machines are popular in Indian casinos and offer the best comps, or complimentary bonuses, of any casino game. The size of the comps can vary depending on the casino, but they are usually worth several thousand rupees. This makes playing slots a profitable proposition, especially if you're a high roller.

Many Indian casinos offer slot tournaments that are also lucrative. Tournaments usually have a buy-in of around Rs. 1,000, and the top prize is often Rs. 50,000 or more. There are also many smaller prizes to be won, so even if you don't take home the top prize, you can still come away with a nice payout.

If you're looking for some excitement and the chance to win big payouts, then playing slots at an Indian casino is definitely the way to go.

#  VIDEO POKER GIVES BEST COMPS AT CASINOS IN INDIA 

Casinos in India offer different types of comps to their players. The most popular form of comps is free drinks, but some casinos also offer free meals, hotel stays, and other gifts.

Video poker gives the best comps of any game at casinos in India. This is because video poker is a relatively slow game, and casinos want to keep players at their tables for as long as possible. As a result, video poker players can often get free drinks, meals, and even hotel stays from casinos.

Other games at Indian casinos also offer good comps, but none are quite as generous as video poker. Players who are looking for the best comps should definitely try out video poker at their next casino visit.

#  Blackjack offers best comps at Indian casinos 

If you're looking for the best casino comps available, look no further than blackjack tables at Indian casinos. According to a study by The Wizard of Odds, Indian casinos offer the best comps of any type of casino, with an average value of $83 per hour.

The study looked at over 100 different Indian casinos across the United States. It found that blackjack offers the best comps, with an average value of $101 per hour. This is more than twice as good as the average comp rate for all other casino games.

So what's the reason for this? One reason may be that Indian casinos are eager to lure in players from nearby states. Many of these casinos are located near large metropolitan areas, so they face stiff competition from local brick-and-mortar casinos and online gambling sites.

Another reason may be that Indian casinos tend to have lower overhead costs than other types of casinos. This is due in part to the fact that many Indian tribes operate their own casinos, rather than partnering with a large casino company.

Whatever the reasons may be, if you're looking for good casino comps, blackjack at an Indian casino is the way to go!

#  Craps players get best comps at Indian casinos

Craps is one of the most popular casino games, and Indian casinos are among the best places to play if you’re looking for comps. Unlike at some Las Vegas resorts, where craps players may receive no comps at all, Indian casinos typically have a comp policy that gives players the best rewards.

In addition to free drinks and occasional food vouchers, many Indian casinos offer free hotel rooms and other perks to their craps players. So if you’re looking to enjoy some great gaming action while also earning rewards, be sure to check out the craps tables at your local Indian casino.
