#  What is the name of the game?

Computer games have been around since the early days of digital computing. In fact, some of the earliest video games were played on computers!

As gaming technology has advanced, so too has the variety and quality of games available to players. Today, gamers can choose from a huge range of titles, from casual mobile games to ultra-complex triple-A titles.

What is the name of the game?

That’s a difficult question to answer, as there are so many great games out there! However, we can take a look at some of the most popular genres in computer gaming and see what makes them so appealing.

First up is the first-person shooter (FPS), which is probably one of the oldest genres in computer gaming. FPS games put players in the shoes of an avatar and allow them to explore virtual worlds and shoot enemies. Some famous FPS series include Halo, Call of Duty, and Battlefield.

Another hugely popular genre is the role-playing game (RPG), which usually features a large open world for players to explore and interact with NPCs (non-player characters). Some famous RPG series include The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Dragon Age.

Finally, we have the strategy genre, which often requires players to make strategic decisions in order to achieve victory. Popular strategy games include Command & Conquer, StarCraft II, and Age of Empires.

#  Who created it?

The blockchain technology was created by an anonymous person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery to this day.

# What is it?

The blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent and tamper-proof transactions. It is used to power cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

# How does it work?

The blockchain is powered by nodes that run the software and help to maintain the network. Transactions are verified by miners who use their computing power to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. Once a transaction is verified, it is added to a block which is then added to the chain. This ensures that the blockchain is always up-to-date and can't be tampered with.

# What are its benefits?

The blockchain has several benefits including:

- Security: The blockchain is secure due to its tamper-proof nature. Transactions cannot be altered once they have been verified by miners. This makes it difficult for hackers to steal data or funds.

- Transparency: The blockchain is transparent as all transactions are recorded on the public ledger. This allows users to trace transactions and track down any malicious actors.

- Efficiency: The blockchain is efficient as it does not require a third party to validate transactions. This saves time and money.

#  What are the main features?

-A 13 inch or 15 inch retina display
