#  What is Triple Bar?

Triple Bar is a unique type of binary options trading strategy that allows you to make money regardless of market conditions. Triple Bar can be used in all markets - up, down, or sideways.

The Triple Bar system is based on three simple bar patterns: the Bullish Engulfing Pattern, the Bearish Engulfing Pattern, and the Inside Bar Pattern.

The Bullish Engulfing Pattern is created when the body of the second candlestick (the bullish candlestick) completely engulfs the body of the first candlestick (the bearish candlestick). The Bearish Engulfing Pattern is created when the body of the second candlestick (the bearish candlestick) completely engulfs the body of the first candlestick (the bullish candlestick). The Inside Bar pattern is created when the body of the second bar is completely contained within the body of the first bar.

To trade Triple Bar, you simply need to identify these three bar patterns and then enter a trade based on which pattern you have identified.

With Triple Bar, you can make money in any market condition - up, down, or sideways!
