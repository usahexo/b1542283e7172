#  C2 Speed Baccarat Comes to the Resorts World Casino

The C2 Speed Baccarat table game has arrived at the Resorts World Casino in Queens, NYC. This new game offers players the opportunity to place bets in a much more streamlined and fast-paced manner than traditional baccarat.

How does C2 Speed Baccarat work?

At a traditional baccarat table, there are three betting areas: Player, Banker, and Tie. With C2 Speed Baccarat, these areas have been replaced by bet circles. To make a bet, simply place your chips inside one of the bet circles.

The game progresses quickly, with cards being dealt out rapidly and placed into the various betting areas automatically. If you want to make a different bet, or raise your current bet, you can do so by using the on-screen buttons.

What are the benefits of playing C2 Speed Baccarat?

There are several benefits to playing this new game. Firstly, it is much faster paced than traditional baccarat, meaning that you can get through more hands in a shorter amount of time. This can be especially advantageous if you are playing for real money – you can make more choices and potentially win more money in shorter amount of time.

Secondly, because there are no designated betting areas, it is much easier to place your bets. You don’t need to know all the different possible bets that can be made – just place your chips inside one of the bet circles and you’re good to go!

Finally, because the game is automated, it is much less prone to human error than traditional baccarat. This means that you can relax and enjoy the game without having to worry about making mistakes yourself.
