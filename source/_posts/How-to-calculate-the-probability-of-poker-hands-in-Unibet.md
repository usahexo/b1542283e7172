#  How to calculate the probability of poker hands in Unibet

There are various ways to calculate the probability of poker hands in Unibet. In this article we will show you three different methods: basic odds, combinatorics and the poker cheat sheet.

## Basic Odds

The basic odds of a poker hand can be calculated by dividing the number of possible outcomes by the number of desired outcomes. For example, the odds of being dealt a pair is calculated by dividing 4 (the number of possible hole cards) by 2 (the number of desired hole cards), which results in a probability of 2/3 or 66.67%.

The odds for other hands can be calculated in a similar way. The table below shows the basic odds for some common poker hands.

Hand Odds Royal flush 1 in 40,000 Straight flush 1 in 72,193 Four of a kind 1 in 693 Full house 1 in 46 Flush 1 in 50 Straight 1 in 114 Three of a kind 1 in 46 Two pair 1 in 21 One pair 1 in 2 No pair 4/52 = 7.69%

## Combinatorics

The combinatorics approach calculates the probability of all possible combinations of poker hands. This method is more accurate than the basic odds, but is also more complicated and time-consuming to calculate. To use this method, you first need to determine the number of ways each type of hand can be made. The table below shows the number of possible combinations for each type of hand.

Type Combinations Royal flush 10 Straight flush 36 Four of a kind 234 Full house 3,744 Flush 5,108 Straight 10,200 Three of a kind 47,584 Two pair 123,552 One pair 2,598,960 No pair 430,944 Total 254,544,800

Next, you need to multiply these numbers together to get the total number of possible poker hands. This number is then divided by 54!, which is the equivalent of all possible permutations for five cards (5 choose 3). This gives us the probability for each type of hand. The table below shows the final results.

Type Probability Royal flush 0.000024% Straight flush 0.000068% Four of a kind 0.026695% Full house 0.097674% Flush 0.131079% Straight 0.236217% Threeofakind 0.516695% Twopair 3.125138% Onepair 68.475597% Nopair 100%

#  How to use the Unibet poker hand calculator

The Unibet poker hand calculator is a handy tool to help you figure out the odds of winning a particular hand. To use it, simply enter the details of the hand and the calculator will tell you your chances of winning.

Here's how to use it:

1. Open the Unibet poker hand calculator in your web browser.
2. Enter the rank and suit of each card in the hand. For example, if you are playing Texas Hold'em and are dealt two queens (rank = 2, suit = spades), you would enter "2s" for the rank and "spades" for the suit.
3. Click on "Calculate Hand."

The calculator will tell you your chances of winning the hand, as well as your chances of getting particular types of hands (e.g., a flush or a straight).

#  Learn how to calculate the odds of a poker hand with Unibet

There are many odds calculators available on the internet, but in this article we will specifically use the one provided by Unibet. 

To start off, we need to know which poker hands rank highest. In descending order, these are: Royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair and one pair.

Now let's assume we are playing Texas Hold'em and have been dealt the following hand:

2♠ 3♥ 4♦ 5♣

The first thing we need to do is work out the odds of hitting each possible hand. We can do this using the following formulas:

Odds of hitting a royal flush = (number of cards in deck) ÷ (number of royal flushes)
Or in our case: (52) ÷ (4) = 13.0% 
Odds of hitting a straight flush = (number of cards in deck) ÷ (number of straight flushes) 
Or in our case: (52) ÷ (10) = 5.2% 
Odds of hitting four of a kind = (number of cards in deck) ÷ (number of foursomes) 
Or in our case: (52) ÷ (252) = 0.21% 
Odds of hitting a full house = (number of cards in deck) ÷ (number of full houses) 
Or in our case: (52) ÷ (4,096) = 1.27% 
Odds of hitting a flush = (number of cards in deck) ÷ (number of flushes) 
Or in our case: (52) ÷ (1,296 ) = 4.04% 
Odds of hitting a straight = (number of cards in deck - 1 ) × ((odds to hit a straight flush)) + ((odds to hit a royal flush)) 

or simplified as :

(51 × 5.2%) + ((2 × 13%)= 31.7%

Therefore, the odds of hitting a straight are 31.7%.

#  The easiest way to work out the probability of a poker hand

The calculation of the probability of any poker hand is a relatively straightforward process. The first step is to calculate the odds of each individual card being drawn from the deck. Once these odds have been calculated, the probabilities for each hand can be easily calculated by multiplying the individual card probabilities together.

For example, the odds of drawing an Ace from a deck of cards is 1 in 4 (or 25%). This means that there is a 1 in 4 chance of drawing any Ace from the deck, regardless of which Ace is drawn. If two Aces are drawn from a deck of 52 cards, the probability of this happening is simply 1 in 4 multiplied by 1 in 4, or 1 in 16 (or 6.25%).

The table below shows the odds for each individual card being drawn from a deck of cards:

Card Odds

Ace 1 in 4 or 25%
2 1 in 6 or 16%
3 1 in 10 or 10%
4 1 in 15 or 6.7%
5 1 in 21 or 4.8%
6 1 in 31 or 3.2%
7 1 in 43 or 2.3%
8 1 in 56 or 1.8%
9 1 in 68 or 1.5%
10 1 in 80 or 1.25%

              

The following table shows the probability of any given poker hand being dealt, based on the odds calculated above:

 Hand Odds Probability % Odds x Probability % Royal flush 5,000 40 1250000 Straight flush 594 9 536400 Four of a kind 3,744 24 911200 Full house 792 16 124800 Flush 505 17 85850 Straight 314 19 60726 Three of a kind 54 108 57632 Two pair 2,748 20 55200 One pair only 7,680 11 84208 No pair 35,472 4 1421888
