#  Sports betting legalized in Andorra - a new opportunity for gambling operators

Sports betting has been legalized in Andorra, a tiny principality located between France and Spain. The new opportunity is seen as a positive development by gambling operators, who see the potential for new profits.

Andorra has a population of just over 85,000 people, and has long been known as a tax haven. The legalization of sports betting offers a new opportunity for gambling companies who are seeking to expand into new markets.

The move follows a trend towards the legalization of sports betting in Europe. Earlier this year, Portugal legalized online sports betting, and earlier this month, the Austrian government announced plans to legalize online casino games and sports betting.

The legalization of sports betting in Andorra will be welcomed by gambling operators, who are looking for opportunities to grow their businesses in light of declining revenues from traditional casino games.

#  Sports betting now available in Andorra - what are the options?

Residents of the tiny principality of Andorra, sandwiched between Spain and France in the Pyrenees mountains, can now enjoy sports betting with a number of licensed operators. The news was confirmed by the government of Andorra in early February and means that locals and tourists will be able to place bets on a range of sporting events, both domestically and internationally.

So what are the options for those looking to place a wager? Well, there are a number of online betting sites that have obtained a license to operate in Andorra. These include Bet365, William Hill, and Bwin.party. Andorrans will also be able to bet at brick-and-mortar establishments including the state-owned lottery operator ONCE and the Racetrack of Escaldes-Engordany.

How do you go about placing a wager? In most cases, you'll need to open an account with one of the licensed online betting sites. Once you've registered your details and deposited some funds into your account, you can then start placing bets on your chosen sporting events. Simply enter how much money you want to risk on each bet (known as your stake), select the outcome you think will win, and hit "place bet".

It's important to remember that not all sporting events are covered by the betting operators in Andorra - for example, horse racing is not currently available. However, football (soccer), tennis, basketball, and rugby are all popular sports that are covered by most bookmakers. You can find out more about which events are available by visiting the websites of individual operators.

So if you're heading to Andorra for a skiing holiday this winter or happen to be living there already, why not check out some of the new betting options now available? With UEFA Euro 2016 just around the corner, there's sure to be plenty of action to get stuck into!

#  New sports betting regulation in Andorra open to online and land-based operators

## Background

The Principality of Andorra has long been known as a tax haven and refuge for those looking to evade authorities. However, following amendments to the country's gambling legislation in March of this year, operators looking to conduct sports betting business in Andorra will now be subject to a number of new licensing and regulatory conditions.

The new regulation is open to both online and land-based operators, and permits betting on a range of sports events, including football, basketball, tennis and Formula One racing. While the regulation does not currently permit betting on horse racing, this is expected to be added in the near future.

Under the new regulations, all operators wishing to offer sports betting services in Andorra must obtain a license from the Principality's gaming regulator, Agència d'Iniciatives Turístiques i Esports (AITE). The licensing process is relatively straightforward, with AITE only requiring applicants to submit details of their company's directors and shareholders, as well as copies of their passports or ID cards.

Licensees must also agree to comply with a number of terms and conditions, including a requirement to prevent minors from accessing their websites or placing bets. They are also required to operate customer service lines that are open from 9am to 11pm CET seven days a week.

Operators who breach any of these conditions may face fines or even suspension or revocation of their licenses.

## What effect will the new regulation have?

It's too early to say definitively what effect the new regulation will have on the sports betting landscape in Andorra. However, it is likely that we will see a number of both local and international operators applying for licenses in order to offer their services in the Principality.

#  First sports betting licenses issued in Andorra - who will take advantage?

On Tuesday, the first sports betting licenses were issued in the principality of Andorra. This is a small country located in the mountains between France and Spain. It's not clear yet who will take advantage of these new licenses, but it's a safe bet that there will be some intense competition among the gambling companies to win market share.

Andorra had been delaying issuing these licenses for some time, apparently waiting for the right moment. That moment may have arrived now that neighboring countries are moving to regulate and tax sports betting more heavily. Many people in Andorra already engage in sports betting, so it makes sense for the government to try and capture some of that revenue.

The main question is which companies will be able to establish themselves in this new market? There are already a few big names in online gambling, such as Bet365 and William Hill. But it's likely that there will be room for other challengers, especially given the relatively small size of Andorra.

Whoever does win out in this battle is likely to see significant profits. The market for online gambling is growing rapidly, and Andorra is a prime location for capturing some of that business. Companies that can establish themselves there early on are likely to have a major advantage as the market continues to develop.

#  Sports betting comes to Andorra: what does this mean for the industry?

The tiny principality of Andorra is to become the latest country to allow regulated sports betting, with news coming this week that the sector will be opened up to operators from January 2019.

This is big news for the online gambling industry, as it represents another small jurisdiction where punters can now place bets on sporting events. Andorra has a population of just over 90,000 people, so it's not a huge market in itself, but its addition to the list of countries with regulated sports betting could be seen as a sign that the industry is starting to mature.

Andorra isn't the only small European country to recently announce plans to regulate sports betting. In October 2018, Malta also said that it would open up its market to operators from early 2019. Malta has a population of around half a million people, so it's a much bigger market than Andorra.

What does this mean for the industry as a whole?

There are two main reasons why the announcements by Andorra and Malta are significant. Firstly, they show that more and more countries are starting to see the benefits of regulating sports betting. The industry is now worth billions of dollars each year, and it provides employment and revenue for many jurisdictions. Regulating it allows governments to collect taxes on profits and helps to protect consumers by ensuring that operators are licensed and meet certain standards.

Secondly, these announcements signal that the industry is becoming more normalized. For years, there was a perception that sports betting was something that was only taken up by illegal operators or those operating on the black market. But as more countries introduce regulation, this perception is changing. More people are becoming aware that sports betting can be enjoyed in a safe and responsible manner, provided that they use licensed and reputable operators.

It's still too early to say what impact Andorra and Malta's decisions will have on the overall size of the global sports betting market. But they are both positive signs for an industry that is continuing to grow at a rapid pace.
