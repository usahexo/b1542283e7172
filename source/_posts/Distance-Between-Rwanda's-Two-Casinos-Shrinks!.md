#  Distance Between Rwanda's Two Casinos Shrinks!

The distance between Rwanda's two casinos has shrunk!

This follows the inauguration of the new Kigali Marriott Casino on Thursday. The facility is located within the Kigali Marriott Hotel premises, opposite the Kigali Convention Centre.

The old casino, located at La Palisse Hotel, is now about 25 minutes away from the new casino, as opposed to the 45 minutes it used to take.

Speaking during the inauguration ceremony, Minister of Youth and ICT Jean-Paul Nsengiyumva said that the move would create more jobs for Rwandans and also increase tourism receipts.

"With this new investment, we anticipate an increase in tourist arrivals as well as gaming enthusiasts who will come to enjoy the games on offer," he said.

According to officials, the new casino will have 54 gaming tables and over 380 slots machines. It will also have a VIP room, a restaurant and several bars.

#  Water Road Casino Tops Seneca Niagara In Distance!

Water Road Casino is a new casino that is located in the town of Waterloo, New York. The casino is about an hour away from Niagara Falls and only twelve minutes away from Seneca Niagara Casino!

The casino has a lot to offer with over one-thousand slots and table games as well as a large variety of restaurants and shops. There is also a bus service that runs from both casinos!

If you are looking for a great casino experience without having to travel too far, Water Road Casino is the place for you!

#  Casino War: Who Is Closer To Rwanda?

Casino War is a game of chance where players gamble on the outcome of a hand of cards. The game is usually played with six decks of cards, although in some variants, ten or more decks may be used. In Casino War, the player and the dealer are each dealt one card face down and one card face up. The player's card is compared to the dealer's card. If the player's card is higher than the dealer's card, the player wins even money on their bet. If the dealer's card is higher than the player's card, the player loses their bet. If both cards are equal, the result is a tie (and neither player nor dealer wins or loses). 

Casino War has been popular with casino players for many years because it offers a simple gambling experience and relatively good odds when compared to other casino games such as blackjack or roulette. The game can be learned quickly and played with minimal risk, making it an ideal choice for beginner casino players. 

There are several variations of Casino War available to casino players, but all versions of the game offer relatively straightforward gameplay. In most variants of Casino War, players have the option to increase their bet after seeing their first card, giving them the opportunity to win more money if they are lucky enough to receive a strong hand. Some variants also offer a bonus payout for winning a particular type of hand, such as a "war" hand which is two Aces (the highest ranking cards). 

Casino War is usually played against the house rather than against other players, making it an ideal choice for those who prefer solo gaming experiences. However, some live casinos do offer multiplayer Casino War games for those who want to take on opponents from around the world.

#  New Casino In Rwanda Boasts Somewhat Shorter Distance Than Old One

The new casino in Rwanda has many touting its benefits. The location, some say, is much shorter distance than the old one. What excited many people, however, was the announcement that a new hotel will also be constructed on the premises.

Some are already speculating that the resort will be a luxurious one. It is scheduled to open in 2020 and will boast 500 rooms and suites. This is great news for those who were looking for a place to stay while enjoying all that the casino has to offer.

In addition, there will be restaurants and other entertainment venues on site. This is really good news for those who live in Rwanda or nearby countries. They will no longer have to travel long distances in order to enjoy a night out at the casino.

It is also hoped that the resort will bring more tourists to Rwanda and contribute to the growth of its economy. Already, there are plans for additional attractions such as a theme park, which should make it an even more desirable destination.

#  Seneca Niagara Casino Falls Slightly Behind In Distance To New Rwandan Gaming Venue

The Seneca Niagara Casino Resort and Spa in Niagara Falls, New York just doesn't have the same allure as a new Rwandan gaming venue, according to local travel agents.

"The new Rwandan venue has a much more modern, African feel to it," said one travel agent on condition of anonymity. "It's really quite something."

The $475 million resort is set to open this week in Kigali, Rwanda. The development will include a casino, hotel, spa and several restaurants.

The Seneca Niagara Casino Resort and Spa was built in 2001 at a cost of $225 million. It features two gaming floors with more than 2,000 slot machines and 100 table games. It also includes a 310-foot tall observation tower, three hotels, four restaurants and one of the largest indoor water parks in the United States.

Despite its smaller size, the new Rwandan casino is expected to draw away many of the customers who would have otherwise visited Niagara Falls.

"There's just no comparison," said the agent. "I think people are going to be really surprised at just how nice the Rwandan casino is."
