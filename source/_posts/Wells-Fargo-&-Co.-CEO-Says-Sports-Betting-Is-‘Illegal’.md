#  Wells Fargo & Co. CEO Says Sports Betting Is ‘Illegal’

In a recent interview, Wells Fargo & Co. CEO Tim Sloan said that he believes sports betting is currently illegal. This comes despite growing momentum to legalize the activity in the United States.

Sloan’s comments may come as a surprise to some, as other major financial institutions have already signaled their support for regulated sports betting. JPMorgan Chase & Co., for example, announced earlier this year that it would be investing in Sportradar, a global provider of sports data and intelligence.

While Wells Fargo has not taken an official position on the issue, Sloan’s comments suggest that the company may be reluctant to get involved in the sports betting industry. This could be a missed opportunity for Wells Fargo, as legalized sports betting could provide a significant boost to the company’s bottom line.

According to estimates from Cowen & Co., the U.S. sports betting market could be worth as much as $7 billion per year. This presents a major opportunity for companies that are able to tap into this market.

At the moment, Wells Fargo appears to be behind the curve when it comes to sports betting. Other companies are already moving aggressively to stake their claim in this growing industry.

#  JPMorgan Chase CEO Believes Sports Betting Should Be Regulated

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon believes that sports betting should be legalized and regulated.

“There is an enormous hypocrisy in not being able to bet on football, or the outcome of a game, when you can bet on other things like the weather or the stock market,” Dimon said in a recent interview with CNBC.

Dimon argued that sports betting is no different than any other form of gambling, and regulating it would provide more government oversight and consumer protection.

He also believes that sports betting could create new jobs and generate tax revenue for states.

The American Gaming Association (AGA) agrees with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon that sports betting should be legalized and regulated.

In a report released in September, the AGA stated that regulated sports betting could create over 150,000 new jobs and produce $26 billion in economic output.

The report also found that legalizing and regulating sports betting would produce $5.3 billion in tax revenue annually for state and local governments.

#  Bank of America CEO Backs Proposed Legislation to Legalize Sports Betting

On Tuesday, April 3, 2018, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan voiced his support for proposed legislation to legalize sports betting. The proposed legislation, which is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Congress, would give states the option to legalize sports betting within their borders.

This move by Bank of America comes as no surprise; the company has been openly supportive of legalized sports betting for some time now. In a letter to shareholders in February of this year, Moynihan wrote that the company believes “sports wagering should be legal and regulated.”

Moynihan’s endorsement of the proposed legislation is a major boost for its prospects; with his backing, the bill stands a much better chance of passing through Congress.

There is good reason for companies like Bank of America to support legalized sports betting; the potential profits from such a venture are huge. A study done by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC estimated that if states were to legalize sports betting, the industry could be worth as much as $6 billion annually.

That amount of money would be a major boon for companies like Bank of America, which could see their profits from traditional banking activities decline over time. As more and more people move away from traditional banking products and services, companies like Bank of America need to find new sources of revenue. legalized sports betting could provide just that.

Of course, not everyone is on board with legalized sports betting. Some people argue that it would lead to an increase in gambling addiction problems and other social ills. Others claim that it would damage the integrity of sporting events.

Despite these concerns, it seems likely that legalized sports betting will eventually become a reality in the United States. With so many states already moving to legalize it and large corporations like Bank of America backing it, it’s only a matter of time until this happens.

#  Citigroup Inc. Executives Voice Support for Sports Betting 

When asked about their thoughts on sports betting, executives from Citigroup Inc. expressed support for the activity, which is currently illegal in most U.S. states.

"We believe that sports betting should be legalized," said J.P. Morgan Securities LLC analyst John McDonald in a research note Monday. "It is a very large and growing market and it is currently being served by a highly inefficient and often corrupt black market."

While details are still being ironed out, executives see potential benefits for the banking sector if sports betting is legalized. These include an increase in credit card usage as well as more opportunities for customer engagement and marketing.

Legalization would also provide a more regulated environment for sports betting, which could help to combat fraud and money laundering.

"We believe that a well-regulated sports betting market could be a positive for the economy and the banking sector," said Citigroup Inc.'s chief financial officer, John Gerspach, during an earnings call last week.

Gambling has been around for centuries, but the debate over legalizing sports betting in the U.S. is a relatively new one. In 1992, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) made it illegal for states other than Nevada to offer gambling services on sports events.

However, PASPA is starting to come under fire, with several states challenging its constitutionality in court. In May of this year, New Jersey won a case against PASPA that allows the state to offer legal sports betting. Other states are likely to follow suit, setting up a showdown with the federal government over who has jurisdiction over this issue.

Banking executives appear to be taking sides on this issue, with some in favor of legalization and others remaining neutral. It will be interesting to see how this debate plays out in the coming years – especially given the potential profits at stake for banks and other businesses if sports betting is legalized nationwide

#  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Eyes Sports Gambling Industry

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon is eyeing the potential of the sports gambling industry, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.

The news outlet’s sources familiar with the matter said that the investment banking giant has been meeting with gaming and sports companies in recent months as it explores ways to get involved in the space. Solomon is said to be particularly interested in how legalized sports betting could help drive more customer activity to Goldman Sachs’ own trading and investing businesses.

 legalized sports betting could be a major boon for investment banks like Goldman Sachs. By getting into the space early, the company could potentially gain a competitive advantage over its rivals and see an increase in business from gamblers looking to place bets on sporting events.

There is certainly no shortage of potential when it comes to sports gambling: global revenue from the activity is expected to reach $81 billion by 2025, according to a report from market research firm Euromonitor International. And that figure doesn’t even take into account legalization in new markets like the United States, which is where Goldman Sachs is focusing its attention.

The move makes sense for the company, especially given that gambling has already been legalized in a number of states including New Jersey, Nevada, and West Virginia. Additionally, Delaware became the latest state to legalize sports betting on June 5th of this year, just days after the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had outlawed the activity. That decision paved the way for other states to follow suit, and it’s likely that Goldman Sachs isn’t the only financial institution looking to capitalize on the trend.

It will be interesting to see exactly what form Goldman Sachs’ entry into sports gambling takes. The company could choose to offer its own betting products and services, or it may simply act as a middleman between gamblers and gaming operators. Either way, it looks like Solomon and his team are ready to make their move and capitalize on what is sure to be a rapidly growing industry.
