#  Are You Ready To Bingo In Arkansas?

Arkansas is known as the Natural State and for good reason. The landscape is peppered with hills, lakes and forests, providing ample opportunity for hiking, fishing, camping, and other outdoor activities. There are also plenty of historic attractions to keep visitors busy, from the Clinton Presidential Library to Mount Ida’s quartz crystal mines.

But what about when you need a break from the great outdoors? Arkansas has you covered there too. The state is home to a number of casinos, most of which are clustered in the Little Rock area. If bingo is your game of choice, you’ll be happy to know that there are plenty of places in Arkansas to put your skills to the test.

Here are five of the best bingo halls in the state:

1. Platinum Casino – Hot Springs

This sprawling casino and bingo hall offers something for everyone. In addition to all-day bingo sessions, Platinum Casino also features a wide range of slot machines and table games. There’s even a steakhouse on site if you get hungry while you’re playing.

2. Oaklawn Gaming Center – Hot Springs

If you’re looking for a smaller and more intimate bingo experience, Oaklawn Gaming Center may be just what you’re looking for. This hall offers smoking and non-smoking sections, as well as a variety of food and beverage options. And don’t forget to try your luck at the slots while you’re there!

3. Diamond Jacks Casino – Bossier City, LA

If you find yourself in north Louisiana, Diamond Jacks Casino is worth a visit. Not only does this casino have some of the loosest slots in the area, but it also offers all-day bingo sessions on weekdays. Plus, with its location right on the banks of the Red River, it’s one of the most picturesque casinos around.

4. Fort Smith Bingo – Ft. Smith

This small but mighty bingo hall offers sessions seven days a week starting at 10am. It may not have all the bells and whistles of some of the larger casinos in Arkansas, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in convenience – it’s located right in downtown Fort Smith!

5. Southland Park Gaming & Racing – West Memphis

If horse racing is more your thing than bingo, Southland Park is worth a visit. This racetrack and casino features live greyhound racing every day except Sunday starting at 7:30pm CST (8:30pm EST). And if that doesn’t keep you busy enough, they also have over 1,500 electronic gaming machines on site!
