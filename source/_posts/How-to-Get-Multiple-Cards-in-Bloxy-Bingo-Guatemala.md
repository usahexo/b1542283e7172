#  How to Play Bloxy Bingo with More than One Card

When playing Bloxy Bingo, many people find it more fun to use more than one card. This helps increase the chances of winning and makes the game more exciting. There are a few ways to play with multiple cards:

## Option 1: Use Two Separate Boards

The first way to play with multiple cards is to use two separate boards. This is a great option if you want to keep track of different patterns on each board. To do this, simply mark which board you are working on at the top of your document. Then, use the corresponding numbers for each card in your grid.

For example, if Board 1 has the pattern B2, C3, D4 and Board 2 has the pattern E5, F6, G7, then your grid would look like this:


Boards 1 & 2:


1) B2, C3, D4 
2) E5, F6, G7

This option is a good choice if you want to keep track of which cards have been called and which have not. It can also help you keep track of patterns on each board.

## Option 2: Use One Grid with Multiple Cards

Another way to play with multiple cards is to use one grid with multiple cards. This option is great for people who want to keep track of all the cards at once. To do this, simply mark which card you are working on at the top of your document. Then, use the corresponding numbers for each board in your grid.

For example, if Board 1 has the pattern B2, C3, D4 and Board 2 has the pattern E5, F6, G7, then your grid would look like this:



 Board 1: 
1) B2  
2) C3  
3) D4  

Board 2: 
1) E5  
2) F6   3) G7

There are many players who enjoy the game of Bloxy Bingo. But, some of those players would like to have more than one card in the game. Unfortunately, that is not currently possible. 

The developers of Bloxy Bingo have not released a statement about whether or not multiple cards will be possible in the future. However, there are a few ways that you can get around this issue and have more than one card in the game.

Another way to play with multiple cards is to use a different device. If you have an iPhone and an Android phone, for example, you can download the Bloxy Bingo app on both devices and then log in with two different accounts. This will also allow you to play with two cards at the same time. 

Lastly, if you don’t want to use a different device or web browser, you can ask a friend to help you out. If your friend has an extra account they can log into Bloxy Bingo and give you their card number. This will allow you to play with two cards at the same time without having to do anything else special.
