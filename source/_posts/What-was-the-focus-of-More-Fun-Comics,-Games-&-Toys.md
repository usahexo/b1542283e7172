In 1910, he opened a second location in Spokane and changed the name to “The More Fun Store.” The new store focused on comics, games, and toys.

In 1946, Hatcher retired and sold the store to his son-in-law, Bob Workman. Workman renamed the store “More Fun Comics, Games & Toys” and continued to operate it until it closed in 1991.
