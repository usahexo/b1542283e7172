#  Albert Einstein's Casino is the Biggest in Atlantic City!

Albert Einstein's Casino (AEC) opened on April 2, 2018 and is the biggest casino in Atlantic City. AEC is a 45,000-square-foot facility with 1,500 slot machines, 75 table games, and a 30-table poker room. It is the only casino in Atlantic City with a hotel attached, the Hyatt Place Atlantic City/Einstein's Casino.

The casino is named for physicist Albert Einstein (1879-1955), who developed the theory of relativity and was one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. "We're excited to open our doors and welcome our guests to experience all that Albert Einstein's Casino has to offer," said AEC General Manager Joe Lupo. "Our team has worked hard to create a one-of-a-kind gaming and entertainment destination and we can't wait to see our guests enjoy everything we have to offer."

AEC occupies the first two floors of the former Trump Taj Mahal casino, which closed in October 2016 after being bankrupted by its owner, Donald Trump. The casino was purchased at auction by Philadelphia developer Carl Icahn for $50 million. Icahn announced plans to reopen the casino under the new name of Albert Einstein's Casino in late 2017.

The new casino has created 1,000 jobs and is expected to generate $175 million in revenue its first year.
