        <h1 id="Wolverines-Add-Military-Grade-Blackjack-Weapon-to-Roster"><a href="#Wolverines-Add-Military-Grade-Blackjack-Weapon-to-Roster" class="headerlink" title="Wolverines Add Military Grade Blackjack Weapon to Roster"></a>Wolverines Add Military Grade Blackjack Weapon to Roster</h1><p>The University of Michigan Wolverines have announced a new weapon in their arsenal for the 2017 football season, adding a military grade blackjack to their playing roster.</p>
<p>“This is an extremely effective tool that can inflict a lot of damage on our opponents,” said head coach Jim Harbaugh. “With this addition, we’re confident that we can take home the Big Ten championship and make a run at the national title.”</p>
<p>The blackjack is a small, handheld weapon that can be used to deliver powerful blows to an opponent’s head or body. It was originally developed for use by the military, but has become popular among law enforcement officers and civilians as well.</p>
<p>Michigan isn’t the first team to add a blackjack to its roster. The University of Utah Utes previously announced their own addition of the weapon, and other teams are likely to follow suit.</p>
<p>In order to utilize the blackjack effectively on the field, players will need to train extensively with it during practice. “We’re going to be working with our players hard so that they can use this weapon effectively against our opponents,” said Harbaugh. “It could make all the difference in the world come game time.”</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-Wolverines-Bolster-Defense-with-New-Military-Grade-Blackjack-Weapon"><a href="#Michigan-Wolverines-Bolster-Defense-with-New-Military-Grade-Blackjack-Weapon" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Wolverines Bolster Defense with New Military Grade Blackjack Weapon"></a>Michigan Wolverines Bolster Defense with New Military Grade Blackjack Weapon</h1><p>The University of Michigan Wolverines football team is seeking to bolster its defense in preparation for the 2017 season with a new military grade blackjack weapon.</p>
<p>Head coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed the acquisition of the new weapon, which is capable of incapacitating an opponent with a single blow to the head, in a tweet on Monday.</p>
<p>“Welcome to Michigan, @Blackjack201!” Harbaugh tweeted.</p>
<p>The new blackjack weapon is reportedly based on the Taser X12, a 12-gauge shotgun that fires two barbed electrodes which stick into the target, delivering an electrical current that disrupts their nervous system.</p>
<p>According to promotional material from Blackjackglobal, the manufacturers of the weapon, the Taser X12 “stops people faster than a 9mm, .40cal or .45ACP handgun and has more stopping power than a baseball bat.”</p>
<p>The Wolverines are not the first football team to adopt such a weapon. The Dallas Cowboys first began using them in 2005 and they are now used by police and military forces around the world.</p>
<p>Michigan Wolverines defensive coordinator Don Brown is said to be particularly keen on utilizing the new weapon in order to better deal with opposing teams’ running games.</p>
<p>“I think it will help us against big offensive linemen who sometimes try to run through our tackles and make big plays in the backfield,” Brown said. “It will definitely help us get them on the ground.”</p>
<h1 id="Harbaugh-Adds-Military-Grade-Blackjack-Weapon-to-Help-Wolverines-Dethrone-Ohio-State"><a href="#Harbaugh-Adds-Military-Grade-Blackjack-Weapon-to-Help-Wolverines-Dethrone-Ohio-State" class="headerlink" title="Harbaugh Adds Military Grade Blackjack Weapon to Help Wolverines Dethrone Ohio State"></a>Harbaugh Adds Military Grade Blackjack Weapon to Help Wolverines Dethrone Ohio State</h1><p>Michigan Wolverines football coach Jim Harbaugh made a shocking announcement this week, revealing that he has obtained a military grade blackjack weapon to help his team dethrone the Ohio State Buckeyes.</p>
<p>“We’re going to take out Ohio State with this weapon,” said Harbaugh. “It’s a game changer.”</p>
<p>The blackjack is a small, handheld weapon that can be used to deliver a deadly blow to an opponent. It is believed that Harbaugh obtained the weapon from the United States Military, which has been known to use them in combat operations.</p>
<p>Officials with Ohio State were caught off guard by the announcement and declined to comment.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Harbaugh has pulled out all the stops in an attempt to beat Ohio State. Last year, he had his team practice in Ann Arbor wearing full pads in 100-degree weather. And in 2014, he had his team dress up like Gladiators and practice at Michigan State’s stadium.</p>
<p>“Coach Harbaugh is a madman,” said one Ohio State official. “He’ll stop at nothing to win.”</p>
<p>Ohio State has won the last two meetings against Michigan, but many believe this year could be different with Harbaugh’s new blackjack weapon. The Wolverines kick off their season against Utah on September 3rd.</p>
<h1 id="UM-Adds-Highly-Effective-Military-Grade-Blackjack-Weapon-to-Assist-in-Pursuit-of-National-Championship"><a href="#UM-Adds-Highly-Effective-Military-Grade-Blackjack-Weapon-to-Assist-in-Pursuit-of-National-Championship" class="headerlink" title="UM Adds Highly Effective Military Grade Blackjack Weapon to Assist in Pursuit of National Championship"></a>UM Adds Highly Effective Military Grade Blackjack Weapon to Assist in Pursuit of National Championship</h1><p>The University of Michigan (UM) Wolverines Football team is looking to take home the national championship this year and they have just announced a new weapon in their arsenal. The UM Athletic Department has obtained a highly effective military grade blackjack weapon which will be used to help the Wolverines achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Assistant Athletic Director for Media Relations, David Ablauf, had the following to say about the acquisition of the weapon: “We are very excited to add this powerful tool to our pursuit of a national championship. The blackjack weapon is proven to be highly effective in assisting in the capture of criminals and we believe that it will give our team an edge over our competitors.”</p>
<p>Some experts have raised concerns that using a blackjack weapon could lead to penalties being called against UM by the NCAA. However, Ablauf insists that the weapon is within NCAA rules and will not cause any violations. “We have spoken with the NCAA and they have confirmed that using a blackjack weapon is within their rules. In fact, several other universities are currently using this same type of weapon with no issues.”</p>
<p>Coach Jim Harbaugh was also enthusiastic about the addition of the blackjack weapon, stating “This is a great addition to our team and I can’t wait to see how it helps us win games. We are going to be unstoppable with this new weapon.”</p>
<p>The UM Wolverines Football team kicks off their season on September 3rd against Hawaii.</p>
<h1 id="Wolverines-bolster-their-chances-at-a-championship-with-a-new-military-grade-blackjack-weapon"><a href="#Wolverines-bolster-their-chances-at-a-championship-with-a-new-military-grade-blackjack-weapon" class="headerlink" title="Wolverines bolster their chances at a championship with a new military grade blackjack weapon"></a>Wolverines bolster their chances at a championship with a new military grade blackjack weapon</h1><p>Michigan Wolverines coach Jim Harbaugh was all smiles as he unveiled the team’s new blackjack weapon. The military grade weapon is designed to give the Wolverines an edge in their quest for a championship. “This is a major advantage for us,” Harbaugh said. “We’re excited to use it to its full potential.”</p>
<p>The blackjack weapon is a highly advanced piece of technology that can be used to incapacitate opponents with a single blow. It is the latest addition to the Wolverines arsenal and is sure to give them an edge on the field. “We’re confident that this weapon will help us win games and bring home a championship,” Harbaugh said.</p>
<p>The Wolverines will debut the blackjack weapon in their upcoming game against Michigan State. Fans are eager to see how it performs on the field. If it lives up to its billing, the Wolverines could be headed for big things this season.</p>
