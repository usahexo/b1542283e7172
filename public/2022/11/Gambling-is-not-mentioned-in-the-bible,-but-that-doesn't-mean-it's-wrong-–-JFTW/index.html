<p>In fact, there are many verses that can be applied to gambling, and they all come down to one thing: personal responsibility.</p>
<p>When you gamble, you are risking something of value in order to gain something else of value. This is a choice that each person has to make for themselves.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time or to make some extra money. But it can also be addictive and destructive.</p>
<p>So, whether you choose to gamble or not is up to you. But remember, gambling is always a risk – and there’s no telling what might happen.</p>

<h1 id="Is-gambling-a-sin-Here’s-what-the-bible-says…-–-JFTW"><a href="#Is-gambling-a-sin-Here’s-what-the-bible-says…-–-JFTW" class="headerlink" title="Is gambling a sin? Here’s what the bible says… – JFTW"></a>Is gambling a sin? Here’s what the bible says… – JFTW</h1><p>Gambling has been around for centuries and is a popular pastime all over the world. But is gambling a sin? What does the bible say about it?</p>
<p>Some people believe that since the bible prohibits gambling, it must be a sin. But is that really what the bible says? Let’s take a look at what scripture has to say about gambling.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to look at is what the bible defines as gambling. Gambling, according to Merriam-Webster, is “to bet on something”. So, basically any action taken with the intent of earning money or gaining an advantage by chance can be considered gambling.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s take a look at what the bible says about gambling.</p>
<p>In Deuteronomy 23:10, God says “If you go into your neighbor’s vineyard, you may pick grapes from it as long as you leave some for your neighbor.” This verse speaks to the principle of generosity and taking care of others. It doesn’t specifically mention gambling, but it does illustrate the idea that there’s no harm in taking advantage of opportunities that come our way, as long as we are considerate of others.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 6:10, Paul says “For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” This verse speaks to the dangers of greed and worshipping money. It doesn’t specifically mention gambling, but it does warn us against getting caught up in worldly pursuits that can have harmful consequences.</p>
<p>So, what does this all mean? Is gambling a sin? Well, it depends on how you look at it. Gambling can certainly be addictive and lead to greed and other negative consequences. But if you’re careful and responsible with your gambling activities, there’s no harm in indulging in them from time to time.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-What-the-Bible-teaches-–-JFTW"><a href="#Gambling-What-the-Bible-teaches-–-JFTW" class="headerlink" title="Gambling: What the Bible teaches – JFTW"></a>Gambling: What the Bible teaches – JFTW</h1><p>Gambling, whether it be playing the lottery, casino games, or betting on sports, is a popular pastime for people all over the world. However, is gambling something that Christians should be involved in?</p>
<p>The Bible doesn’t specifically mention gambling, but there are principles in Scripture that can help us answer this question. The first principle we need to look at is the principle of stewardship. What does the Bible say about how we are to use the resources God has given us?<br>In 1 Timothy 6:17-19, Paul says “Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.”</p>
<p>From this passage we see that God wants us to use our resources wisely and generously. He doesn’t want us to be arrogant or trust in wealth that can be taken away from us at any moment. Rather, we are to put our trust in Him who provides everything for our enjoyment. This includes money and possessions.</p>
<p>Another principle we need to consider is the principle of righteousness. What does the Bible say about how we are to live our lives?<br>In Romans 12:17-21 Paul says “Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord . On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.”<br>Our goal as Christians should be to live obedient lives that reflect Christ’s love towards others. We are called not to take revenge on those who have done wrong against us, but instead show them love and forgiveness. This includes our enemies. Jesus taught us this principle when He said Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you (Matthew 5:44).</p>
<p>Based on these principles it seems that gambling would not be an appropriate activity for Christians since it goes against biblical teachings on stewardship and righteousness. Gambling can often lead to greediness and bitterness towards others when things don’t go our way. It can also lead people astray from trusting in God alone as their source of provision and security.</p>
<p>While there may not be a clear answer regarding every specific instance of gambling, based on what the Bible teaches it seems that Christians should generally avoid participating in this activity</p>
<h1 id="Should-Christians-gamble-Here’s-what-the-Bible-says…-–-JFTW"><a href="#Should-Christians-gamble-Here’s-what-the-Bible-says…-–-JFTW" class="headerlink" title="Should Christians gamble? Here’s what the Bible says… – JFTW"></a>Should Christians gamble? Here’s what the Bible says… – JFTW</h1><p>While gambling is often seen as a pastime that is frowned upon by Christians, the Bible doesn’t actually say much about it. In fact, there are some instances where gambling is encouraged in the Bible. So, what does the Bible say about gambling?</p>
<p>The first time gambling is mentioned in the Bible is in the book of Genesis, when Abraham bets his nephew Lot on whether or not he can beat him in a race. Abraham ends up winning the bet, and Lot is forced to hand over his possessions.</p>
<p>In the book of Proverbs, there is an instance where gambling is seen as being foolish. In Proverbs 28:22, it says “A stingy man stirs up strife, but he who trusts in the LORD will be enriched.” This suggests that gambling can lead to fights and arguments between people.</p>
<p>However, there are also instances where gambling is seen as being acceptable. In the New Testament, there is an account where Jesus heals a man who was paralyzed from the waist down. The man had been waiting by the pool of Bethesda for 38 years, hoping that someone would jump into the pool and heal him. When Jesus healed him, he asked Jesus if he could get his money back (since he had been waiting so long). Jesus told him to go and gamble with it all (Mark 5:36).</p>
<p>So, what can we take away from all this? The Bible doesn’t explicitly condone or condemn gambling – it’s up to each individual Christian to decide what they think about it. There are certainly verses which suggest that gambling can be harmful, but there are also verses which suggest that it can be OK under certain circumstances. Ultimately, it comes down to whether or not you believe that God wants you to gamble or not.</p>
