It was located in the heart of downtown Spokane. The store’s focus was on comics, games, and toys. It was one of the first stores in Spokane to sell comic books and it became a popular destination for gamers and toy collectors.</p>
<p>The store was originally opened by Charles Hatcher in 1903 as the “Hatcher Dry Goods Company.” Hatcher sold general merchandise, such as clothing, shoes, and hats. In 1910, he opened a second location in Spokane and changed the name to “The More Fun Store.” The new store focused on comics, games, and toys.</p>
<p>The original location of The More Fun Store was destroyed by fire in 1915, but Hatcher reopened the store later that year. The store continued to thrive and expand over the years. In 1946, Hatcher retired and sold the store to his son-in-law, Bob Workman. Workman renamed the store “More Fun Comics, Games &amp; Toys” and continued to operate it until it closed in 1991.</p>
